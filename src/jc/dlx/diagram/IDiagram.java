// Diagram representing a general set cover problem. After Donald E. Knuth,
// see http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/dance.w.
//
// Each column of the input matrix is represented by a Column instance,
// and each row is represented as a linked list of Node instances. There's one
// Node for each nonzero entry in the matrix.

// More precisely, the Nodes are linked circularly within each row, in
// both directions. The Nodes are also linked circularly within each column;
// the column lists each include a header node, but the row lists do not.
// Column header nodes are embedded in a Column instance, which contains further
// info about the column.

// As backtracking proceeds downwards, nodes will be deleted from column lists when 
// their row has been blocked by other rows in the partial solution.
// But when backtracking upwards, the data structures will be restored to their
// original state.

// One Column instance is called the root. It serves as the head of the
// list of columns that need to be covered, and is identifiable by the fact
// that its name is null.
//
// To initialise this class, call addColumn for each column in the matrix,
// the call addRow for each row. Depending on the usage, the client can add
// all possible rows and columns, then specify a number of 'solved' rows by
// calling addHint. Or the hinted cells can be accounted for during the
// initial construction of the diagram, as the original Knuth algorithm does.
