#TODO

* research to see if there are any other simple strategies that can be added
* define a difficulty metric and when the simple strategies fail to find a way forward, use DLX to find the least 'difficult' chain that will yield some progress.
* expand on the current GUI's capabilities:
 * enable load/save of puzzles
  * manipulate the diagram to allow manual solving
  * add arbitrary markup to the diagram as a solving aid
* genarally enhance the GUI:
 * use stylesheets to provide theme capability
 * make the GUI resposive to window size changes
